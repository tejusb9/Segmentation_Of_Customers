# Introduction

While working in a company that serves goods to thousands of customers in several countries, I wanted to **create a tool** that would be useful to the sales managers in those countries by quickly showcasing **what customers to contact next**, in order to **grow sales** and **customer retention**. That is how I came to know about RFM analysis.

**RFM** is a method used for analyzing customer value. It is commonly used in database marketing and direct marketing and has received particular attention in retail and professional services industries.

This project focuses on doing RFM analysis on company sales and creating a **data visualization dashboard** showcasing **customer segmentation** that I can share with colleagues in the countries.

![Customer Segmentation Small](https://github.com/daniel-isidro/customer_segmentation/blob/main/media/customer_segmentation_small.png?raw=true)

# Methodology

Using a dataset that contains **sales orders** in a period of time, we will use **Python** to obtain the **frequency, recency** and **monetary** values in the last 365 days per customer. Later with those values we will give **R, F, and M scores** to each customer, that will allow us to cluster them in different **segments**.

# Requirements

We'll use the [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) Jupyter notebook environment (free), with Python 3.7 or higher, and [Microsoft Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/) application (free download, Windows only).

### Python packages

* numpy
* pandas
* math
* datetime
* dataprep
* matplotlib

# Execution Guide

For replicating the project, please execute the following steps in order:

1. **[Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/daniel-isidro/customer_segmentation/blob/main/code/customer_segmentation_asia.ipynb)**. Running this notebook the data will be explored, prepared, and the RFM segmentation will be performed. The output will be a [CSV file](https://github.com/daniel-isidro/customer_segmentation/blob/main/output/rfm_asia.csv).

2. **[Power BI file](https://github.com/daniel-isidro/customer_segmentation/blob/main/output/customer_segmentation.pbix)**. This is a file that processes the CSV file obtained in the previous step and presents it as a dashboard so it can be leveraged for business actions in the countries.

# Data Acquisition

Data has been obtained from **real sales orders** in 18 countries in a period of around 2 years. Some features (country names, customer id and revenue), have been altered in order to preserve privacy. Number of orders, units and dates have not been modified. It is acquired as a [CSV file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daniel-isidro/customer_segmentation/main/data/sales_asia.csv).

# Data Preparation

We import the CSV and we put it into a dataframe with pandas. We know from domain knowledge that every row of the dataset is a different  order.

`df1.head()`

<table class="dataframe" border="0">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>country</th>
      <th>id</th>
      <th>week.year</th>
      <th>revenue</th>
      <th>units</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>KR</td>
      <td>702234</td>
      <td>03.2019</td>
      <td>808.08</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>KR</td>
      <td>702234</td>
      <td>06.2019</td>
      <td>1606.80</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>KR</td>
      <td>3618438</td>
      <td>08.2019</td>
      <td>803.40</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>KR</td>
      <td>3618438</td>
      <td>09.2019</td>
      <td>803.40</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>KR</td>
      <td>3618438</td>
      <td>09.2019</td>
      <td>803.40</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Also, we notice that the date is expressed as **week of the year**, so for better analysis we convert it to **year-month-day** format with the datetime package. Also we rename 'revenue' to 'monetary' per convention in the RFM analysis.

We see we have **235,574 transactions** and 5 **columns** in the period of time included in the dataset. The biggest transaction was 150,000 units. But it seems there was a return of that amount as well, -150,000 units. The most expensive purchase was 2.41 Millions.

Let's view the period of time included in the dataset:

`df2['date'].min()`

```
Timestamp('2019-01-07 00:00:00')
```

`df2['date'].max()`

```
Timestamp('2020-11-30 00:00:00')
```

Let's explore in how many different countries we have sales in that period:

`df2['country'].unique()`

```
array(['KR', 'PK', 'MM', 'VN', 'IN', 'SA', 'PH', 'AF', 'CN', 'BD', 'ID',
       'TH', 'IQ', 'MY', 'JP', 'IR', 'TR', 'UZ'], dtype=object)
```

With the dataprep.clean package we can get the full country names:

`clean_country(df2, "country")['country_clean'].unique()`

```
array(['South Korea', 'Pakistan', 'Myanmar', 'Vietnam', 'India',
       'Saudi Arabia', 'Philippines', 'Afghanistan', 'China',
       'Bangladesh', 'Indonesia', 'Thailand', 'Iraq', 'Malaysia', 'Japan',
       'Iran', 'Turkey', 'Uzbekistan'], dtype=object)
```

Total number of customers in all countries:

`df2['id'].nunique()`

```
21837
```

# Data Exploration

For greater visibility in the plots we convert the dates to monthly periods:

`df2c = df2b.to_period("M")`

`df2c.head()`

# Modeling

## Transforming the data to obtain RFM values

We will transform the data to assign each customer some scores depending on the purchases they did. Prior to that, we will create some new features 'recency', 'frequency', as long as the previoulsy created 'monetary' feature.

**Recency** will be the minimum of 'days_since_last_purchase' for each customer.

**Frequency** will be the total number of orders in the period for each customer.

**Monetary**, will be the total value of the purchases in the period for each customer.

We will focus on sales from last 365 days since the most recent date.

**TIP:** There are customers with the same 'id' in several countries. This causes errors in the monetary values. We will solve this by creating a new feature: a unique 'id+' identifier that combines country code and customer id.

`df3['id+'] = df3['country'].map(str) + df3['id'].map(str)`

`df3.head()`

## Calculating the R, F and M scores

No we'll assign a rate between 1 and 5 depending on recency, monetary and frequency parameters. We'll use the quintiles method, dividing every feature on groups that contain 20 % of the samples.

Higher values are better for frequency and monetary, while lower values are better for recency. Those will be the asssigned R, F and M scores to each customer.

Then we concatenate R, F and M values to obtain a combined RFM score per customer.

With this rfm scores we would have 125 segments of customers, which is too much for any practical analysis. To get a more simple segmentation, we choose to create a new feature 'fm' that is the rounded down mean of 'f' and 'm' scores.

`def truncate(x):
    return math.trunc(x)`

`rfm['fm'] = ((rfm['f'] + rfm['m'])/2).apply(lambda x: truncate(x))`

Then we create a segment map of only 11 segments based on only two scores, 'r' and 'fm'. We assign to each customer a different segment.

# Summary

After aggregating sales, frequency and recency values for each customer, and assigning 'r' and 'fm' scores depending on those values, we have given each customer a different segment label. Let's have a look on what those segments mean.

## Segment description

* **Champions**	Bought recently, buy often and spend the most
* **Loyal Customers**	Buy on a regular basis. Responsive to promotions.
* **Potential Loyalists**	Recent customers with average frequency.
* **Recent Customers**	Bought most recently, but not often.
* **Promising**	Recent shoppers, but haven’t spent much.
* **Customers Needing Attention**	Above average recency, frequency and monetary values. May not have bought very recently though.
* **About To Sleep**	Below average recency and frequency. Will lose them if not reactivated.
* **At Risk**	Purchased often but a long time ago. Need to bring them back!
* **Can’t Lose Them**	Used to purchase frequently but haven’t returned for a long time.
* **Hibernating**	Last purchase was long back and low number of orders.
* **Lost** Purchased long time ago and never came back.

Let's do a scatter plot to explore the distribution of customers, with 'recency' on the x-axis and 'frequency' in the y-axis. Using the 'monetary' values as size of the points, we see that the majority of customers who **spend the most** also purchase **more recently** and **more frequently**.

![Scatterplot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daniel-isidro/customer_segmentation/main/media/scatter.png)

Finally we export the dataframe to a CSV file for later processing it in Power BI.

`rfm.to_csv('rfm_asia.csv', encoding='utf-8', index=False, float_format='%.2f')`

# Front-end

The front-end of this project consists in a **Power BI dashboard** that processes the CSV resulting from executing the previous Python code, and visualizes the results in a pleasing dashboard. That dashboard then can be shared with multiple colleagues in the different countries of the company. You can access that file [here](https://github.com/daniel-isidro/customer_segmentation/blob/main/output/customer_segmentation.pbix) for exploring it.

![Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/daniel-isidro/customer_segmentation/blob/main/media/customer_segmentation.png?raw=true)

![RFM Analysis](https://github.com/daniel-isidro/customer_segmentation/blob/main/media/rfm_analysis.png?raw=true)

We observe that a lot of our customers (32 %) are **lost** or **hibernating** (they have a few orders from long ago). However, 28 % of our customers are either **champions** or **loyal customers**, meaning they spend the most and frequently. A segment to take care is **can't lose**, second segment with highest revenue, comprised of customers who used to spend a lot but have not returned in a while.

### User Manual

We can share the dashboard with our country sales managers so they can be **guided to the customer id's on the different segments** and **take specific actions on them**. Let's view an example: my Chinese colleague needs to be guided on what customers to contact next to **improve customer retention** or to **increase sales**. They would just need to open this dashboard, click on country (top right) and then on customer segment **need attention** or **at risk**, to have a specific list of customers, ordered by revenue spent in the last 365 days. (An unedited dataset would also include customer names and contact details, which in this case have been omitted for privacy reasons).

![Country - Need Attention](https://github.com/daniel-isidro/customer_segmentation/blob/main/media/cs_cn_need_attention.png?raw=true)

![Country - At Risk](https://github.com/daniel-isidro/customer_segmentation/blob/main/media/cs_cn_at_risk.png?raw=true)

A **reference guide** to the 11 segments and suggested actions per segment is included in the last tab of the dashboard.

# Conclusions

**Customer segmentation** with the **RFM** methodology in sales is an effective way to help employees to focus their efforts by **targeting customers on a priority basis** and taking different actions on them. This kind of project **flexible** as the number of segments can be adapted to the business needs, and the period of time in the analysis can be extended or reduced as well. The use of Power BI to **share** the dashboard to colleagues in an enterprise environment as a web app is very convenient for companies already working in the Microsoft ecosystem.
